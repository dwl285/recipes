ingredients:
  - 1 tbsp olive oil
  - 1 onion, halved and thinly sliced
  - 1 fennel bulb, halved, cored and thinly sliced, - fronds reserved
  - Handful chopped flat-leaf parsley, leaves and stalks - separated
  - 2 garlic cloves, crushed
  - ½ tsp sweet smoked paprika
  - 2 tbsp Belazu Rose Harissa
  - 400g can chopped tomatoes
  - Pinch caster sugar
  - 400g can chickpeas, drained and rinsed

method:
  - Heat the oil in a large non-stick frying or sauté pan over a medium heat. Add the onion, fennel, chopped parsley stalks and a pinch of salt, cover with a lid and sweat gently for 10 minutes, until softened but not coloured. Uncover, add the garlic and fry for another 3 minutes, stirring, until everything is just starting to turn golden.

  - Add the paprika and harissa and fry, stirring, for another 2 minutes, then add the chopped tomatoes and sugar. Half-fill the empty can with water and add to the pan. Simmer for 10 minutes, then add the chickpeas; season and simmer for a final 5 minutes.

  - Serve the stew sprinkled with the roughly chopped parsley leaves and reserved fennel fronds, with the dairy-free yogurt alternative on the side.
