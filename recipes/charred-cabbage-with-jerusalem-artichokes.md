## ingredients

- 400g jerusalem artichokes, scrubbed clean with wire - wool
- 120ml extra-virgin olive oil
- Salt

### For the cabbage

- 4 tbsp vegetable or rapeseed oil
- 1 january king cabbage, or 2 hispi cabbages, - quartered through the stems
- 1 tbsp sherry vinegar
- 150g cooked chestnuts, roughly chopped

### For the green sauce

- 60g olive oil
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 1 red onion, peeled and finely chopped
- 2 large handfuls parsley leaves, finely chopped
- 3 tbsp sherry or white-wine vinegar

## method

1. Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan). Cut the artichokes into bitesize chunks and put into a steamer. Steam until tender, around 20 minutes. Put into a bowl and pour in the olive oil. Blitz smooth with a hand blender, then season and set aside somewhere warm.
2. Heat one and a half tablespoons of the vegetable oil in a large frying pan. When hot, add two of the cabbage quarters and press down hard so they have plenty of contact with the pan. Cook them for a few minutes until dark and charred, then turn, using a pair of tongs, to fry the other cut sides until charred. When done, sprinkle over half the vinegar, leave to bubble up then transfer the cabbage to a baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining quarters.
3. Season the charred wedges and roast in the oven for 10-15 minutes, until tender in the middle.
4. Meanwhile, wipe the frying pan and return it to the heat. Once hot, add the final tablespoon of vegetable oil. Add the chestnuts, then season and stir-fry until crisp and golden-edged. Transfer to a piece of kitchen paper to drain.
5. To make the green sauce, gently heat the oil and paprika in a small pan. Once it begins to bubble, take off the heat and stir in the onion, parsley and vinegar. Season and leave to cool.
6. Spoon the warm artichoke puree on to plates, put a wedge of cabbage on top, spoon the sauce over and scatter the crisp chestnuts on top.

## tips

Use leftover chestnuts to make a stuffing for crown prince squash with sauteed onion, garlic and herbs, or blitz them with cream and rum and serve topped with grated dark chocolate. Leftover artichokes can be made into an incredibly silky, comforting soup with thyme, garlic and a touch of truffle oil, or go new wave and have them for pudding in the form of ice-cream
