ingredients:
  - << For the pastry >>
  - 200g wholemeal or light spelt flour
  - 1 sprig rosemary, leaves picked and finely chopped
  - Zest of 1 unwaxed lemon, finely grated
  - 1 pinch salt
  - 50ml olive oil
  - Cold water
  - << For the filling >>
  - 400g cherry tomatoes, halved
  - Salt and black pepper
  - Extra-virgin olive oil
  - 1 leek, finely sliced
  - 2 sprigs rosemary, leaves picked and finely chopped
  - 450g asparagus
  - 3 eggs
  - 3 tbsp creme fraiche
  - Zest of 1 unwaxed lemon, finely grated
  - 1 tsp dijon mustard

method:
  - Heat the oven to 120C. Lay the tomatoes cut side up on a baking tray, season, drizzle with olive oil, then slowly roast for about an hour, until soft, sweet and gummy. Take a handful out for the dressing, and set aside. Once the tomatoes are roasted, take them out of the oven and turn the heat up temperature to 180C.

  - Next make the pastry. Put the flour, rosemary, lemon zest and salt into a food processor. Pulse a few times, then add the olive oil and pulse again until you have crumbs. Add about 75ml of cold water until it comes together in a ball. (If you don’t have a food processor you can do this just as easily by hand.)

  - On a floured work surface, roll it out to just bigger than the tart tin, then carefully wrap it around your rolling pin and lower it into the tin. Gently press it in, so the pastry takes the shape of the tin. Prick with a fork and blind bake for 12 minutes (no need to use baking beans for with this pastry).

  - Saute the leek in a little oil for 20 minutes until soft and sweet, add the rosemary and cook for a minute. Put a large pan of salted water on to boil. Snap the asparagus spears spears near the base – they will naturally break off where the fibrous part ends. Boil the asparagus for two to three minutes, until the spears are still firm but not crunchy. Drain, season at once and drizzle with oil.

  - Mix the eggs with the creme fraiche, sauteed leeks, zest and dijon, then season. Once the pastry is ready, scatter with the asparagus, then pour over the creme fraiche mixture and scatter with the tomatoes.

  - Bake the tart on the bottom of the oven at 200C for 15-20 minutes, until the pastry is crisp and the eggs just set. Serve with a sharply dressed green salad

tips: Make double pastry and freeze for next time
