serves: 2
category: "main"
ingredients:
  - 400 g mixed mushrooms
  - 1 red onion
  - 2 cloves of garlic
  - 4 silverskin pickled onions
  - 2 cornichons
  - 4 sprigs of fresh flat-leaf parsley
  - olive oil
  - 1 tablespoon baby capers
  - 50 ml whisky
  - smoked paprika
  - 80 g half-fat crème fraîche

method:
  - Get all the prep done before you start cooking. trim the mushrooms, tearing up any larger ones and leaving any smaller ones whole, peel and finely slice the red onion and garlic, and finely slice the pickled onions and cornichons. Pick and roughly chop the parsley leaves, finely chopping the stalks.

  - Place a large non-stick frying pan over a high heat, throw in the mushrooms and red onions, shake into one layer, then dry-fry for 5 minutes (this will bring out the nutty flavour), stirring regularly. Drizzle in 1 tablespoon of oil, then add the garlic, pickled onions, cornichons, parsley stalks and capers. After 3 minutes, pour in the whisky, tilt the pan to carefully flame, or light with a long match (watch your eyebrows!), and, once the flames subside, add ¼ of a teaspoon of paprika, the crème fraîche and parsley, then toss together. Loosen with a splash of boiling water to a saucy consistency, and season to taste with sea salt and black pepper.

  - Divide between plates, sprinkle over a little paprika, and serve with fluffy rice.
