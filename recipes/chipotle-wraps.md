ingredients:
  - 1 tbsp vegetable oil
  - 1 onion finely sliced
  - 1 garlic clove
  - 1 pack of ‘chicken’ nuggets
  - 1 pack of smoked tofu
  - 2 tbsp chipotle paste
  - 400g can chopped tomatoes
  - 400g can black beans, drained
  - 4 large corn or flour tortilla wraps
  - ½ avocado, stoned, peeled and sliced
  - ½ Baby Gem lettuce, shredded
  - 1 lime halved

method:
  - Heat the oil in a frying pan over a low-medium heat. Toss in the onion and cook for 10 mins until softened. Crush in the garlic and stir for 1 min before adding the smoked tofu. Turn up the heat and brown the tofu n all over. Spoon over the chipotle and stir to coat for 1 min. Pour in the tomatoes and bring to the boil. Season well and reduce the heat to a gentle simmer.

  - Cook for 5-6 mins or until any excess liquid has evaporated. Stir the beans through until warmed, then remove from the heat.

  - In the meantime cook the ‘chicken’ nuggets in a small frying for about 4 minutes on each side and warm the wraps following pack instructions (8 mins in the oven, wrapped in foil). Divide the mix between the wraps, top with the avocado and shredded lettuce, and squeeze over the lime.
