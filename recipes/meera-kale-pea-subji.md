ingredients:
  - 1 tsp cumin seeds
  - 1 tsp fennel seeds
  - 3 tbsp rapeseed oil
  - 1 tsp black mustard seeds
  - 1 onion, peeled and finely chopped
  - 3 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped
  - 3 leeks (about 500g), trimmed and finely sliced
  - 600g chestnut mushrooms, quartered
  - 1 ¾ tsp red chilli powder
  - ½ tsp ground turmeric
  - 1 ¼ tsp salt
  - 200g kale, chopped
  - 150g frozen peas

method:
  - Put the cumin and fennel seeds in a mortar, and bash until they’re fairly well ground.

  - Heat the oil in a large frying pan for which you have a lid, then add the ground spices and the mustard seeds, and stir-fry for a minute, until the cumin turns a shade darker. Add the onion and cook, stirring often, until soft – around six minutes – then add the garlic and cook for two minutes more.

  - Add the leeks and cook until they’ve softened and unravelled – around five minutes – then add the mushrooms. It will seem as if there are too many to fit in the pan, but they will soon wilt.

  - After five minutes, when the mushrooms are juicy, add the chilli, turmeric and salt, then stir in the kale, and cook for eight minutes, until the stems and leaves are tender. Throw in the peas and cook for two or three minutes more, until they are hot and soft.

  - Check the subji for chilli and salt, adjust to taste, and serve with hot chapatis and a dairy-free yoghurt of your choice.

tips: Make sure your dairy-free yoghurt isn’t sweet. Provamel soya is a good option.
