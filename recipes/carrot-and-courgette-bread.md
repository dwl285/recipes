ingredients:
  - 200g plain white flour
  - 100g whole wheat flour
  - 1 tsb baking powder
  - ¾ tsb bicarbonate of soda
  - Pinch of sugar
  - 1 tsp dried thyme
  - 1 carrot, grated
  - 1 courgette, grated
  - 175ml plant milk
  - 50g walnuts
  - 2 tbsp mixed seeds
  - Salt & pepper
  - Hummus to serve
method:
  - Preheat the oven to 200C
  - Mix the fry ingredients into a large bowl with ½ tsp salt and set aside. Squeeze the grated carrot and courgette to remove any excess liquid and season with a little pepper. Add the carrot and courgette mix to the dry ingredients and stir well.
  - Make a well in the centre and pour in the plant milk and then gently fold in using a spatula, ensuring not to overwork the mixture. Stir through the walnuts and seeds.
  - Dust a little flour over a work surface and a baking tray. Turn the mixture out onto the surface and shape into a rough oval about 30 cm in diameter.
  - Transfer the dough to the baking tray, score the top with a sharp knife and sprinkle over a little more salt, thyme and seeds.
  - Lightly dust the loaf with flour and bake for 30 minutes or until it sounds hollow. Sprinkle over a little more salt, thyme and extra seeds.
tips: Squeeze out excess water from carrot and courgette using a cloth or kitchen towel and/or use a little less than 1 of each. Cooking time is more like 45 mins in my experience.
