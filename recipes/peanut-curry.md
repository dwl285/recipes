## ingredients

- 2 tbsp peanut butter (vegan of course)
- Tin of chickpeas
- One brown onion
- One red pepper (capsicum)
- Two red chili peppers (optional if you don't like - spice)
- Three small/medium sweet potatoes
- Two carrots
- Handful of fresh spinach leaves
- One tin coconut milk
- Oil for frying and roasting
- Handful of peanuts (optional)

## method

1. Cut the carrots and sweet potatoes into bite size chunks. Cover them with oil (I used 1cal spray) and season with salt and pepper. Place in the oven 200c for approximately 20/25 minutes or until they soften.
2. Dice the onion and the chili. Fry over high heat. (I use rapeseed oil).
3. Once the onions start to discolour chop and add the red pepper. I left those in larger chunks for bite.
4. Drain the chickpeas and add to the pan. Stirring and lowering the heat to medium. If you're adding extra nuts this is the stage to add them.
5. Helpful tip: place the nuts onto some kitchen towel, fold it over (covering the nuts) and bash them into pieces with a rolling pin. Just make sure you don't catch your fingers. You could use a plastic bag too but I try not to use the stuff.
6. Add the peanut butter and keep stirring. It sticks quickly so turn the heat down to low as soon as that happens and add the coconut milk.
7. Cover the pan with a lid and let it simmer for ten minutes.
8. Remove the lid and see the liquid has reduced. Add the spinach, stir and replace lid for 5 minutes.
9. By now the oven should be done so remove the sweet potato and carrot. Add them to the curry and stir.
10. Leave the lid off for a few minutes until the curry is at your desired thickness. Then serve. I served with rice but it would go nice with bread too.
