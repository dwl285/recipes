ingredients:
  - 800g canned chickpeas or 720g jar giant chickpeas
  - 3 onions, quartered
  - 3 garlic cloves
  - 5cm piece of ginger
  - 2-3 green chillies, roughly chopped
  - 1½ tbsp ghee
  - ½ tsp ground coriander
  - ½ tsp ground cumin
  - ½ tsp chilli powder (Kashmiri if possible)
  - 1 tsp turmeric
  - 1 tsp garam masala
  - 1 ½ tsp amchoor powder (optional)
  - 3 medium tomatoes (around 300g), roughly chopped, or - 400g can chopped tomatoes
  - 1 lemon, juiced
  - ½ small pack coriander leaves, to serve

method:
  - Drain the chickpeas, add to a large pan with 400ml of water and season. Bring to the boil, then turn off the heat and set aside to allow the chickpea flavour to infuse the water.

  - Blitz the onions with the garlic, ginger and green chillies. Melt the ghee in a large saucepan, then add the onion mix with a pinch of salt and cook for 8-10 mins, until softened.

  - Stir in the spices, and cook for 3 more mins, adding a splash of the chickpea water to stop them sticking to the bottom of the pan. Add the tomatoes and another splash of water and cook for 5 mins, squishing the tomatoes with a spoon as they soften. Tip in the chickpeas, along with their cooking water. Cook for 10 mins. Season well, add the lemon juice, and a splash of water if you like a looser curry. Scatter with the coriander, to serve
