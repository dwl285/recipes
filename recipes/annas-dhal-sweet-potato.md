  - 2 sweet potatoes, skins on, washed and roughly chopped into 1.5cm - cubes
  - sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
  - 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
  - 1⁄2 teaspoon fennel seeds
  - olive oil
  - << for the dhal >>
  - 2 cloves of garlic, peeled and chopped
  - a thumb-size piece of fresh ginger, peeled and roughly chopped
  - 1 green chilli, finely chopped
  - 1 red onion, peeled and roughly chopped
  - 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
  - 1 teaspoon coriander seeds
  - 1 teaspoon ground turmeric
  - 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
  - 200g red lentils
  - 1 × 400ml tin of coconut milk
  - 400ml vegetable stock
  - 2 large handfuls of spinach
  - a bunch of fresh coriander, roughly chopped, stalks and all
  - juice of 1 lemon
  - << for the coconut chutney >>
  - 50g unsweetened desiccated coconut
  - 1 teaspoon black mustard seeds
  - 10 curry leaves
  - a little vegetable or coconut oil
  - a 20g piece of fresh ginger, grated
  - 1 red chilli, finely chopped

method:
  - Preheat your oven to 220°C/fan 200°C/gas - Pour 150ml of boiling water over the coconut and leave to soak. Put your sweet potatoes on a roasting tray and add a good pinch of salt and pepper, the cumin and fennel seeds and a drizzle of olive oil. Roast in the oven for 20–25 minutes, until soft and sweet in the middle and crispy brown on the outside. In a large saucepan, sizzle the garlic, ginger, chilli and red onion in a little oil for about 10 minutes, until soft and sweet. Grind the cumin and coriander seeds in a pestle and mortar, then add to the pan with the other spices and cook for a couple of minutes to toast and release the oils. Add the lentils, coconut milk and stock to the pan and bring to a simmer, then turn the heat down and bubble away for 25–30 minutes.
  - While that is cooking make your chutney. Drain the coconut and put it into a bowl. Fry the mustard seeds and curry leaves in a little oil until they begin to crackle, then pour the mixture over the coconut. Season with salt and pepper, then stir in the ginger and chilli and give it a good mix. To finish your dhal, take it off the heat, then stir in the spinach and allow it to wilt a little, stirring in half the chopped coriander and the lemon juice too. Pile into bowls and top with the crispy sweet potatoes, spoonfuls of the coconut chutney and the remaining coriander. I serve this with charred chapattis or roti, and if you are really hungry you can have some fluffed brown basmati rice too.

tips: Good with pitta bread naans. Chop up lots of garlic and slice the pittas into - Fry the pittas in oil with garlic until crispy.
